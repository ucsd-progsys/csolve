* Align structure pointers properly
  If the function takes a pointer to a structure, as in

  : fprintf (FILE * fp, ...)

  one must take care that fp points at the right place. In this case,
  fp must point at the start of the FILE structure:

  : fprintf (FILE * START fp, ...)

  This is automatically done, along with other things, with the
  PTR_TO_ONE macro:

  : fprintf (PTR_TO_ONE(FILE) fp, ...)

* Check for global locations
  Some functions stash pointer arguments away in globals, meaning that
  it's not possible to quantify over their locations.
* Use LCC_IO_FILE and LCC_IO_FILE_PTR
  For performance reasons, we want to abstract away the contents of
  _IO_FILE structures, so use these macros, defined in libio.h.
* Use existing global location names if any
  Be sure to check if there's already a name for any global locations
  you're introducing so as to not miss potential aliasing.
